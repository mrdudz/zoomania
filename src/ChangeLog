Changes since Preview 2 (ninja@the-dreams.de)

    * extract binary blobs, add Makefile; now source is in compilable state
      (Compiled with CC65 V2.12.0 using Linux)

    * detect "no more moves" correctly in conjunction with a joker
      Those bugs delayed the original release. One found by j0x/WOW, one by me

    * get your time bonus even shortly before time runs out

    * no music fragments while saving the hiscore

    * demo mode exits if it fails (which happens rarely)

    * no initial garbage characters when entering highscore

    * fix timer delay on first game after loading

    * fix case with broken screen in demo mode

    * disable kernal messages on restart

    * remove trailing white spaces from source

    * update scrolltext & default highscores
