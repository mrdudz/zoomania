Changes since Preview 3 (groepaz@gmx.net)

    * trivial changes in linker config to make it work with latest cc65
      snapshot (Compiled with CC65 V2.12.9 using Linux)

    * enabled compiler optimizations in the makefile

    * trivial bugfix in the "clean" target

    * made assembler functions that return "unsigned char" properly set the
      X register to zero before returning to conform with cc65 calling
      conventions. (not doing this may result in odd behaviour/bugs)

    * fixed a bug that prevented it from working on NTSC (yay!)

    * changed ingame interupt to use 50hz timers, the onslaught release is
      much harder to play on NTSC than on PAL since the time is still driven
      by the raster irq.

Changes since Preview 2 (ninja@the-dreams.de)

    * extract binary blobs, add Makefile; now source is in compilable state
      (Compiled with CC65 V2.12.0 using Linux)

    * detect "no more moves" correctly in conjunction with a joker
      Those bugs delayed the original release. One found by j0x/WOW, one by me

    * get your time bonus even shortly before time runs out

    * no music fragments while saving the hiscore

    * demo mode exits if it fails (which happens rarely)

    * no initial garbage characters when entering highscore

    * fix timer delay on first game after loading

    * fix case with broken screen in demo mode

    * disable kernal messages on restart

    * remove trailing white spaces from source

    * update scrolltext & default highscores
