    * updated for recent cc65


2011 - Final RC2 (groepaz@gmx.net)

    * fixed bug with bonus/joker piece becoming corrupted when pausing the game
      when it is active. (bug reported by l.a.style)

2011 - Final RC1 (groepaz@gmx.net)

    * trivial changes in linker config to make it work with latest cc65
      snapshot (Compiled with CC65 V2.13.9 SVN version: 4974M using Linux)

    * disabled cbm+shift (switch case) (bug reported by l.a.style)

    * changed scroller to say "final version"

    * some more cosmetic code cleanup

2010 - Final Preview (groepaz@gmx.net)

    * trivial changes in linker config to make it work with latest cc65
      snapshot (Compiled with CC65 V2.13.9 using Linux)

    * enabled compiler optimizations in the makefile

    * trivial bugfix in the "clean" target

    Fixed bugs:

    * made assembler functions that return "unsigned char" properly set the
      X register to zero before returning to conform with cc65 calling
      conventions. (not doing this may result in odd behaviour/bugs)

    * at various places only fire button port 2 was checked (so player 2 could
      not skip certain screens)

    * all hardcoded delay loops and wait-for-rasterline in main loop removed and
      replaced by a frame-synced function, which makes the various delays much
      more predictable :)

    cosmetical changes/additions:

    * added screenwipe when leaving title screen, reworked fld, added color fading
      and music fade out.

    * added screenwipe and music fade out when leaving high scores

    * added cursor on high score name entry

    * fixed various glitches when switching screens (junk displayed for a fraction
      of a frame)

    * added a/w/s/d + shift keyboard input for player 1 (joystick port 2)

    * joystick port one can now also be used in the title screen (however, a single
      player game can only be started using joystick in port 2)

    NTSC related:

    * fixed a bug that prevented it from working on NTSC (missing instruction)

    * changed ingame interupt to use 50hz timers, the onslaught release is
      much harder to play on NTSC than on PAL since the time is still driven
      by the raster irq. this also truely fixes the cause of the "animal
      insertion bug" mentioned by onslaught.

    * reworked ingame multiplexer to work with the 50Hz timer irq

    * reworked all other interrupt handlers, music always runs in a 50Hz timer
      interrupt so it plays at correct speed at all times in NTSC

    -> the game should behave in NTSC exactly as in PAL now (talk about a true
       ntsc fix...)

    other:

    * some source cleanup

    * update scrolltext & default highscores

15 January 2009 - Preview V3 + [pal/ntsc] (Onslaught)

    [ http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=74715 ]

    Fixed bugs (for NTSC):
    - Random animal insertion now runs fine on NTSC. This was for some reason due
      to a raster comparison problem related to the contents of the accumulator.
      This was fixed by setting accumulator to a fixed value. See code at $0dba
      for details.
    - Fixed small bug in the multiplexer during animals dropping.
    - Unwanted char memory was flickering under the white colour bar on the title
      screen. This was easily fixed by setting the char colours to the background
      colour, hiding away the appearance.

13 January 2009 - Preview 3 (ninja@the-dreams.de)

    [ http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=74653 ]

    * extract binary blobs, add Makefile; now source is in compilable state
      (Compiled with CC65 V2.12.0 using Linux)

    * detect "no more moves" correctly in conjunction with a joker
      Those bugs delayed the original release. One found by j0x/WOW, one by me

    * get your time bonus even shortly before time runs out

    * no music fragments while saving the hiscore

    * demo mode exits if it fails (which happens rarely)

    * no initial garbage characters when entering highscore

    * fix timer delay on first game after loading

    * fix case with broken screen in demo mode

    * disable kernal messages on restart

    * remove trailing white spaces from source

    * update scrolltext & default highscores
